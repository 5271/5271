### Hello! :3

I'm a 16 year old guy doing programming 💻 as a hobby for about 3 years now. I'm a privacy concerned person and I also really like the idea of **free** and **open-source** software as i am a very ✨ freedom  ✨ loving person. For that matter my main OS is ＧＮＵ／Ｌｉｎｕｘ (~~I use Arch btw uwu~~ no more - i use Fedora now :3). <br>
I'm creating usefull or interesting little programs (because i can't do anything bigger \<w\>) and my main goal is to ease a bit someone's life and also if someone got interested popularize Nim which is in my opinion a great programming lanugage.<br><br>

Edit: I've recently fallen in love with Rust and it's so good .w.

###### Thank u for reading this all x3 and if you are already there then maybe you could check some of my projects and star one if you like it. It would be very much appreciated ^-^
